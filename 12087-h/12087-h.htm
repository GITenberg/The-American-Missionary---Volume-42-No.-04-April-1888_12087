    <h4>American Missionary Association.</h4>
    <hr class="quarter" />
    <a name="editorial1" id="editorial1"></a>
    <p>We acknowledge with gratitude to God and to his people the fact that our receipts
    during the month of February are such as greatly to encourage us.</p>
    <p>We are cheered, not only by the benevolences which are reporting themselves from
    the churches, but also by the kind words of sympathy and helpfulness which show us
    anew that this great and exigent work upon us was never nearer than now to the hearts
    of our pastors and churches.</p>
    <p>We may add that the month just past and those immediately before us are those upon
    which we must largely depend for our fiscal year. We are coming to the summer season,
    when contributions are less likely to be taken. We trust that those who believe that
    God has called the American Missionary Association to this immense work in the name
    of Christ, will not cease to pray that the hearts of men may be moved to heed the
    appeals of those who, through us, ask for the very bread of life, and who will not
    have it unless we carry it to them.</p>
    <p>We are now compelled to deny more appeals for help which ought to be heard than we
    are granting. Several schools which were begun by private enterprise with good
    intent, are now asking us to take them from their hands upon our own, where they can
    be perpetuated and saved. We would like to save these schools to the needy people
    whose hope is in them, and to protect the churches from indiscriminate appeals for
    works which they have not authorized, and which we could do with greater economy and
    better care; but for this we need a generous increase of gifts. Our faith was in Him
    who said, "Knock, and it shall be opened unto you," and the doors were opened. God
    withdrew the bolts of hindrance and said, "Beloved, I have set before you an open
    door." Our faith is in Him who also said "Ask, and ye shall receive."</p>
    <hr />
    <p>A friend has just sent us eighteen subscriptions to the <i>American
    Missionary.</i> This might be repeated easily by a thousand friends. There is <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>{88}</span> scarcely a
    self-sustaining church in the United States where it could not be done by one who
    would try to do it as an act of missionary love. Some who read this, perhaps, will
    try and will succeed.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>The name of Rev. Frank Cross, who was appointed to the charge of the Rosebud
    Indian Mission, was by mistake not printed in the roll of workers. He is there,
    however, and his work has gone on bravely and hopefully.</p>
    <hr />
    <a name="editorial2" id="editorial2"></a>
    <p>We wish that the extent, and necessity, and hopefulness of our mountain work, were
    more fully understood by our readers. Now is our opportunity and the accepted time to
    answer the most urgent appeals from this neglected region in the heart of our
    country. Our Congregational churches are just what are needed to uplift these people.
    One of our earnest missionaries writes us:&mdash;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"The A.M.A. has done a work here to be profoundly grateful for as a beginning,
      but thus far it is only playing around the edge of its mountain work. This mountain
      region is of great extent. Sober calculation from facts already gleaned, makes a
      thousand Congregational churches in these mountains the possibility of the future,
      if only the strategic points can now be occupied. One church and one school to a
      county, should be our immediate aim; then we can throw upon these the work of
      developing native teachers and preachers for the rest. There are forty counties
      waiting for us, and all our mountain work so far is in three or four. I see this
      place where I am, changing like magic under the influence of school and church, but
      the necessity for our going forward oppresses me. I am ready for any additional
      labor, and will carry any burden my strength will permit, if only the American
      Missionary Association will take for its motto, 'One church and one school in every
      mountain county, as fast as they can be established.' I feel, when I see the need,
      as if I could plead the money right out of the most self-indulgent members of our
      favored churches at home. It would not be expensive as compared with other
      missionary work. Cannot some way be devised for making a large advance on the
      present movement?"</p>
    </blockquote>
    <hr />
    <p>Those who thought to cripple Atlanta University because it could not yield its
    principles for the sake of a State appropriation of $8,000 made a mistake. They have
    helped that which they meant to hinder. The university will get the money. Joseph's
    brethren took counsel together and said, "We will see what will become of his dream,"
    and they thought they had a sure thing when they put him in a pit, but they
    discovered <span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>{89}</span> some
    years after that this was but a way-station on the direct road to the Viceroyship of
    Egypt, and they saw what became of his dream.</p>
    <p>When Napoleon the First wished to hinder the Huguenot Church, he gave it a small
    stipend in order to retain hold of it. He appropriated just enough to keep it a
    cripple. When the State of Georgia thought the education of the Negro was becoming
    too marked, it reversed the policy of the far-seeing Bonaparte and took its hands
    off. We have never thought that Napoleon was a truly good man, but we do believe that
    he had a larger idea of the philosophy of control than the author of the Glenn Bill.
    If the State had held on, it might have hindered, but it has lost its hold.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Would it not sound well to the American people to have it said that in the United
    States of America, in the year 1888, our missionaries were imprisoned for reading the
    Bible to a heathen tribe of Indians who lived remote from civilization, the crime of
    it being that it was read in the only language which they could understand?</p>
    <p>Yet "the orders are," writes a missionary, "that we shall hold only two services
    on a Sunday and two during the week, and that we shall cease to read the Bible in the
    Indian homes." This is the Government authority of the great and free United States,
    but is there any authority greater than God?</p>
    <hr />
    <a name="editorial3" id="editorial3"></a>
    <p>In an eloquent address at the Old South Church in Boston, on Sunday, March 4th,
    George W. Cable accentuated in strong words the work in which we are engaged. "Here
    is the mightiest, the widest, the most fruitful, the most abundant, the most
    prolific, missionary field that was ever opened to any Christian people."</p>
    <p>We quote from his address:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The benevolence of Northern men and women, yea, and even of Northern children,
      helped to establish in the South these missionary colleges, these educational
      missions, wherein not the black man alone, not the black woman alone, but every one
      who was qualified with orderly behavior and a rational intellect might come, and
      get, not only an education, but a Christian education, and not only a Christian
      education, but a Christian American education. These institutions, standing out in
      the darkness when nothing else stood by them, when the land was racked and torn and
      bled afresh under the agonies of reconstruction, these institutions began and
      carried on the blessed work of raising up leaders, intellectual leaders, among the
      black people, for the guidance and stimulation of the colored race toward the
      aspirations of American citizenship and Christian intelligence.</p>
      <p>These institutions, these missionary colleges in the South, have carried the
      torch of liberty, these have upheld it, these have taught American citizenship,
      these have given to the Southern States 16,000 colored teachers, when nobody else
      would teach the poor black boy&mdash;nay, or the poor white boy either. Seven
      millions of people concerned in the matter, and the National Bureau of Public
      Education reporting year after year that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page90"
      id="page90"></a>{90}</span> the reason why there are 600,000 colored youth out of
      the public schools, is not because they don't want to go, but because there are not
      school-houses and school teachers.</p>
      <p>Here is the mightiest, the widest, the most fruitful, the most abundant, the
      most prolific, missionary field that was ever opened to any Christian people. It is
      right here at your doors. It is not across the Pacific Ocean and it is not down
      yonder around the Cape of Good Hope. Right here at our doors is the greediest
      people for education and the gospel there is on the face of this earth, not counted
      among our white race. I suppose that ninety-nine one-hundredths of those who
      generously give to this cause believe to-day that it is being given to in generous
      proportion. Ah! you never figured on it. Why, if you knew the national value of
      this work, to say nothing of its gospel value, you would quadruplicate it before
      the year is out. You would not submit to it for a moment, as citizens, not merely
      as members of Christ's Church.</p>

    <p>The American Missionary Association is called again to mourn the decease of one of
    its officers. Hon. Alfred S. Barnes, a member of its Executive Committee, after an
    illness extending over five months, at his residence in Brooklyn, finished his
    earthly life on Friday, February 17th, at the age of seventy-one years. Mr. Barnes
    was elected on the Executive Board of the A.M.A. nineteen years ago, and had served
    in that capacity continuously up to the day of his death. He was a wise counsellor,
    large-minded in his views and honorable in his spirit, known throughout the land as
    one of the foremost publishers in the country, largely interested in educational
    work, and yet he found time for an earnest devotion to various enterprises in the
    Christian church. His fidelity and helpfulness in the service of the A.M.A. are fully
    known only to those who were associated with him. Many organizations of missionary
    and Christian work will miss his presence and the help of his generous stewardship,
    but none will feel his departure more truly than the American Missionary Association,
    which has lost its President, one of its Secretaries, and this long-honored member of
    its Executive Board within the last half-year. The greatness of his work in our
    service will be remembered and cherished.</p>

    to tell what it sees. If the high standard of literary excellence so far sustained
    can be continuously held, we shall have a magazine of missions which will be the peer
    of our best literary monthlies in quality and interest.</p>

    <p>We congratulate the Congregational Sunday-School and Publishing Society on the
    acceptance of its appointment of Rev. Geo. M. Boynton as its Secretary. We have known
    him as a member of the Executive Committee of the American Missionary Association, as
    editor of THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY, as a pastor, as a secretary of Associations and
    Conferences, as a wise counsellor and genial brother. We regard him as eminently
    fitted for the place to which he has been called. To Brother Boynton we extend most
    cordially a welcome to the honorable, the fraternity of the Secretaries.</p>

    <p>The fifth annual report of the Executive Committee of the Indian Rights
    Association, written by Mr. James B. Harrison, is a strong and valuable contribution
    to the literature of Indian rights and wrongs, which should be considered by every
    friend of the Red Man. Respecting the orders of the Indian office at Washington which
    abridge the liberty of religious teaching, this report characterizes them as
    "unintelligent, arbitrary, despotic and unstatesmanlike, merely a blow at missionary
    work. There is no reason to suppose that a single Indian anywhere will ever learn ten
    words more of English by reason of these orders. There is, indeed, no provision made
    by the Government for any increase of facilities in the study of English. The damage
    to the missionary work produced by these orders is their sole result. The orders
    should be distinctly and wholly revoked and withdrawn. It is not necessary that the
    missionaries and churches should submit. If they will publish the facts fully these
    orders will be revoked. The facts must come to light. Then the people of the country
    will have something to say."</p>
    <p>The above quotation will give our readers the flavor of the pages. "Plain words
    are best," and it is time that the country should have them. <span class="pagenum"><a

    Report without having his heart stirred with honest indignation at the condition of

    <h6>LETHER.</h6>
    <p>Lether is mad from the hide of animals. They first kill the animal then the hide
    is sent to a tan yard and there it is tan are made lether from, then to a shoemaker's
    shop where it is made into boots shoes saddles. The finest of gloves is the kid skin
    glove, that is all I will say about kid skin gloves. Most of the bad boots and shoes
    we have is horse lether or mule lether, that is all I will say about mule lether and
    horse lether. All the good boots and shoes we have is young calf lether, that is all
    I will say about young calf lether.</p>
    <p>All the boots shoes and every thing else we have made of lether is second thing
    because some poor animal was rob-ed of his coat that we might have boots and many
    other things.</p>

    <h6>NETELY.</h6>
    <p>Netely are clean always and handsome to everybody. It are good in the cite of God
    and man for it are a good thing to be netely always for it make a man look netely. If
    we all are netely it are a good thing to be clean for it are a good thing in the time
    of life so to be. Netely is deserving of everybody and grate with all mankind. It are
    a good thing to be netely for it is beautiful and pretty. It are correct always and

    <h4>A SERIOUS ALARM IN GEORGIA.</h4>
    <p>The American Missionary is not published for the entertainment of its readers. It
    has a more serious purpose. It speaks for races who have suffered grievous wrongs,
    and for peoples whose condition is exceedingly sad. It has to do with tragic facts,
    and much of what it has to say must excite compassion, and must appeal both to the
    consciences of our readers and to their sense of duty. To call upon those whom God
    has blessed, to insert themselves into the woes and spiritual wants of others who
    need their help, is grave and serious.</p>
    <p>This is one feature. There are others. The joy of the work and the joy of the
    worker, which we are called to record, are a relief to the stories of necessity, and
    are like beautiful pictures painted upon the dark background. When "Our eyes have
    seen the glory of the coming of the Lord," we can for the time forget the darkness
    upon which the light shines, and sing our hallelujahs. If it is saddening to tell of
    the night, it is cheering to mark the fact that the providences of God are working
    out his promises, and are surely bringing in God's day.</p>
    <p>Over and above the evils to which we must call earnest heed, the dangers which are
    not far away, and the exigencies of the cause of Christ, we are sure that no one can
    read the MISSIONARY without being cheered and quickened in gratitude to God for what
    he is graciously doing for his needy ones through his people.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>With the serious duty on the part of those who are working together with God for
    the salvation of men, there drift along in the current of his providences certain
    incidents that are exceedingly droll.</p>
    <p>As we have seen some very ludicrous manifestations of character and conduct in the
    terrible struggles of a battlefield, and have brushed aside our tears at times for an
    irrepressible <i>bon mot</i> in a hospital, so in the weighty and solemn
    considerations which continually appeal to us, and while we are anxiously asking how
    we can make the most bricks for the Lord's building with the least straw, incidents
    arise which not only throw light upon our serious work, but which are irresistibly
    amusing.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>We think we should share with our readers a recent one which, when <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>{94}</span> we read it in the
    detail, impossible to be repeated here, made us smile. Every time we re-perused it we
    thought it, as <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> said, "curiouser and curiouser."</p>
    <p>Our readers are not strangers to the name and fame of the leading editor of the
    chief paper in Georgia. They have heard of him as an eloquent orator with a brilliant
    imagination which saw a New South in almost millennial array, and told of it with an
    enthusiasm so contagious that to the sons of the Pilgrims after the fulness of a
    great dinner it seemed that the "Promised day of Israel" had at last arrived. It is
    true that when this dinner had been thoroughly digested, certain ones, removed from
    the afflatus of the occasion began to ask, "Are these things so?" And when the Glenn
    Bill sought the endorsement of public opinion, and substantially received it with no
    word of reprobation from the eloquent orator and editor, some recalled the speech of
    Sheridan in reply to Mr. Dundas, "The right honorable gentleman is indebted to his
    imagination for his facts."</p>
    <hr />
    <p>In all this time no one suspected the <i>Atlanta Constitution</i> of possessing
    the humorous character which it has lately revealed. In late issues of February it
    has, in the garb of gravity, about two columns that are ridiculously funny.</p>
    <p>It appears that Prof. Sumner Salter, a graduate of Amherst College, a son of an
    honored pastor of Iowa, a musical director of exceptional gifts and a teacher of
    eminent ability, was solicited by parties in Atlanta to take his residence there in
    the interest of the musical cultivation of such as could secure his services. He soon
    attracted the patronage of society, and all went smoothly until the tempter came.
    Alas, there was a serpent in Eden, so there was a skeleton in the closet of the
    <i>Atlanta Constitution</i>. It was a dreadful skeleton. The <i>Constitution</i>
    seriously publishes the fact that "it was whispered about for some time," until
    patience ceased to be a virtue, when it sent a guardian of public safety in the form
    of a reporter to investigate. "Was it really true that a white man who was giving
    music lessons to white people was also teaching a colored class at another time and
    place? If so, what about the New South? The black man had no business to be black,
    but he <i>was</i> all the same, and being so what right had Prof. Salter to teach
    <i>colored</i> people to sing? Let the matter be thoroughly searched out. The
    reporter departed on his mission, with a countenance more in sorrow than in anger,
    and returned <i>vice versa</i>.</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>"'Tis true, 'tis pity,</p>
        <p>And pity 'tis 'tis true."</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>The professor was actually doing this very absurd thing. He had taken charge of a
    colored class in the church of which Rev. Evarts Kent is minister and was teaching
    them how rightly to use the talents with which God had so richly endowed them.</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>{95}</span>
    <p>Accordingly, in the year of grace 1888, the <i>Atlanta Constitution</i> publishes
    the astounding fact, and calls the world to heed it, in conspicuous head
    lines:&mdash;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"WHITE OR BLACK&mdash;A PROMINENT MUSICIAN WHO TEACHES BOTH COLORS&mdash;HIS
      BUSINESS SAID TO BE INJURED."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Then followed the whole sad story. The musician had been interviewed and
    investigated. He did not deny the serious charge to this superintendent of public
    proprieties. With a heart as hard as old Pharaoh's he proposed to go on and do more
    likewise. In short, the representative of the <i>Constitution</i> could do nothing
    with this intractable professor. Hence "he did not stand upon the order of his going,
    but went at once," and reported that "<i>according to Mr. Suiter's own statement, he
    is teaching a colored class</i>, and he has lost a white pupil, which shows that his
    course is hurting his business." "Diligent inquiry has failed to bring to light any
    proof that he has notified his <i>white</i> pupils that he is teaching <i>colored</i>
    people."</p>
    <p>Leaving out the meanness of this, has anyone read anything published lately more
    ridiculous? It is not necessary to quote the professor's public reply. It simply
    claimed the right of manhood and common sense, and doubtless left the
    <i>Constitution</i> wondering how a man capable of making it appear so foolish could
    yet descend to such depths of ignominy as to teach people whose ancestors came from
    Africa, the unpardonable sin of singing praises to the Author of their being. To what
    deeps some will descend! Why should colored people add to the criminality of being
    born black, the fearful temptation of pay in advance to one who could teach them
    while he had pupils who had the merit of having been born white?</p>
    <p>This was really transpiring in the city of Atlanta several days in the month of
    February in the year 1888, and was in successive issues of the <i>Constitution</i>,
    which shows among other things that there is latitude, if not longitude, at a
    Brooklyn New England dinner. Meanwhile we think we hear Uncle Rastus quoting the
    prophecy, "The morning cometh and also the night," but he can't help laughing because
    it is "awful funny."</p>

    <h4>THE EDUCATIONAL WORK IN THE SOUTH.</h4>
    <p>BY REV. W.F. SLOCUM.</p>
    <p>We may remember at the outset that in this matter of the education of the Negro we
    are treating a question which must be considered, to a certain extent, ethnically. We
    are dealing with a people with race peculiarities: but it seems to me that it is very
    useless to ask whether we are training an inferior stock. There was a time when the
    Anglo-Saxon stock was far inferior <span class="pagenum"><a name="page96"
    id="page96"></a>{96}</span> to its present condition. We ourselves are not enough
    removed from heathenism and barbarism to become very pharisaical.</p>
    <p>Here is a race with its idiosyncrasies, and its peculiar latent possibilities,
    which we cannot know until Christian education has unfolded them through many years.
    We ought not to wonder that in many respects this people is yet in its moral and
    intellectual infancy; but who dares say that it has not a future before it, with its
    statesmen, its poets, its painters, its men of letters; that it is not to have its
    own peculiar literature, its art, and even its own characteristic religious
    expression, just as marked and important as those produced by any other race?
    Certainly we have as much reason for believing it as that the Teutonic race of the
    second century should produce its Goethe and its Schiller, its Kant and its Hegel,
    its Luther and its Melanchthon; or that the Frank of the fifth century should develop
    its Victor Hugo, its Lamartine, its Madam de Stael; or that out of the barbarism, the
    cannibalism, the paganism of Norseman, Briton and Saxon, there should come
    Shakespeare, Spencer, Macaulay, Browning and Gladstone. And we may not have to wait
    as long; for in spite of slavery's binding chain thrice drawn round his soul, the
    American Negro has been absorbing during the past from a civilization which has been
    fitting him somewhat for the large Christian movement of the present. We are working
    for a people which in all probability will form at least one-eighth of our whole
    population; and we have the problem of lifting them as a race up into Christian
    enlightenment. The dark skin is growing darker. There will be less and less of
    intermixture of blood between the two races. Hence all study of this educational
    question must have in view the large moral and intellectual enterprise of dealing
    with a race as a race. I believe that there is nothing in all history to compare with
    this opportunity which has come to our very doors. Here is a nation in our land and
    with it every perplexity, every difficulty, every embarrassment, and also every
    encouragement, every hope, and every inspiration for work, that can appeal to any
    foreign missionary. Here is this God-given task laid at our very thresholds and with
    all the sentiments of patriotism and Christian devotion urging us to our large
    privilege.</p>
    <p>What the race needs now is right leadership, and for many years to come we are to
    equip men and women religiously and intellectually, who, in home, in church, in
    social and business life, will be moral and social leaders. And by this power of
    leadership I mean something far other than those foolish conceits which have taken
    possession of a few who have touched only the surface of the new life that is coming
    to this people.</p>
    <p>I have rather in mind leaders who shall have that moral and intellectual fitness
    which produces reverence, earnestness and humility, leaders who can draw their people
    away from their foolishness, weakness and self-consciousness into the larger life
    that is possible for them. Without a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page97"
    id="page97"></a>{97}</span> doubt, what is needed is true leaders, and I wish to show
    where these leaders are now demanded.</p>
    <p>Before the war, the South knew nothing of the benefits of public schools, and the
    private school was in harmony with its social and political conceptions; but of late,
    and especially during the last decade, a remarkable change has taken place which is
    doing as much to affect the whole Southern problem as anything that has occurred
    there during half a century. It is a movement in the South, which, however
    imperfectly it has been developed as yet, has come to remain, and will ultimately
    affect every institution, social, political and religious, in our section of the
    country.</p>
    <p><i>It is now being recognized in every Southern State that free government is
    based upon a public common-school system</i>. It has taken two decades to incorporate
    this public school policy upon Southern institutions, but it has now the evidence of
    permanency and it is offering to Christian philanthropy an unparalleled opportunity,
    such as God seldom gives to any people, and one which should rally the churches as
    never before in support of the great enterprises of the American Missionary
    Association.</p>
    <p>There has been forced upon the New South the conclusion that the best way to
    increase its wealth is to increase the number of educated, intelligent producers, and
    with this conclusion it realizes that it cannot afford to let two million colored
    children grow up in hopeless illiteracy. It perceives that its very institutions will
    be imperiled by such a condition. I have through personal interviews with leading
    educators in a recent trip through the South, by correspondence and by a careful
    examination of documents and reports from nearly all the Southern States, undertaken
    to find just what is being done at the present time in the public colored schools of
    the South.</p>
    <p>The significance of this public school movement will be understood when it is
    remembered that the acceptance of the idea that the constitution of a free State
    rests on universal education, marks a great change in theory; that this has come
    against the opinions of the old Bourbon party, which never forgets, and, it is to be
    feared, never learns; whose political economy is represented by the expression, "keep
    the negro down"; which regards his enfranchisment as a political outrage and his
    education as a mistake and a failure; that it has risen in the face of the poverty of
    the South and in the midst of its most intense prejudices. For when the new
    educational movement began, the property and a large part of the intelligence
    belonged to the opponents of the new educational policy, but now, in the words of a
    prominent Southern gentleman: "The conviction has become very deep that in the
    altered condition of our people the only hope left us is to do all that can be done
    towards elevating the masses irrespective of race." This certainly represents a
    tremendous transformation. Without stopping to trace the causes that produced it, or
    even the large place the American Missionary Association work has in it, let me
    simply quote from <span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>{98}</span>
    a Southern Christian man, whose sympathies are full of prejudice against the North,
    but who has wakened with the awakening of the New South.</p>
    <p>Writing of the educational movement, in a recent book, he says: "Not a few of the
    best men and women of the North have come to teach in these institutions for colored
    youth: their motives and their work have not always been understood, but the Great
    Day will make manifest how they have been constrained by the love of Christ, to spend
    years in work which has had many discouragements." ('The New South' by J.C.C.
    Newton.) A few statistics may give some general idea of the extent of this
    movement.</p>
    <p>The State of Alabama has 104,150 colored pupils enrolled in the public schools. It
    pays an average of $25.97 per month to nearly 2,000 colored teachers, and expends
    altogether $198,221 upon these colored schools. Georgia has 49 per cent. of its negro
    school population enrolled; that is, 119,248. In 1871, this State had 6,664 only in
    all public and private colored schools. Its teachers of this race now number 2,272.
    40,909 colored children are enrolled in Louisiana, with 672 negro teachers, who
    receive an average of $23.73 per month.</p>
    <p>Mississippi had last year 154,430 colored scholars. It employed 3,124 colored
    teachers who receive an average of $28.73 per month. North Carolina enrolled, in
    1886, 117,562 colored pupils, employed 2,016 teachers of the same race, paying them
    about the same as its white teachers, $23.38 per month. The colored school population
    of Tennessee numbers 158,450, of whom 84,624 are enrolled in her 1,563 common
    schools, which are taught by 1,621 teachers of the same nationality. A county
    superintendent voluntarily adds: "I should do our colored teachers an injustice
    not to speak of them. Most of them are earnest, zealous workers, doing all in their
    power for their race."</p>
    <p>Turning now to Texas we find that this State has nearly doubled its enrollment of
    colored pupils in three years, which now number 62,040, with 1,696 licensed colored
    teachers who receive on an average, $41.73 per month. Virginia has 111,114 out of a
    school population of 265,249 with 1,734 colored teachers who receive $28.65 per
    month.</p>
    <p>That is, in eight representative States there are eight hundred thousand colored
    pupils who are now being trained by over fifteen thousand teachers of the same race.
    Now the simple but grave question that every Christian patriot ought to ask himself
    is, "What kind of teachers are these, and where are they to come from in the future?"
    I asked that question of a gentleman who of all others ought to be able to answer it
    correctly and he replied, "Nine-tenths of these teachers come from the missionary
    schools, and of these nine-tenths, more than one-half come from the institutions of
    the American Missionary Association." Now we can understand the truthfulness of the
    testimony of the Rev. J.L.M. Curry, D.D., the distinguished agent of the Peabody
    Fund, who says: "The most that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page99"
    id="page99"></a>{99}</span> has been done at the South fcr the education of the
    negroes has been done by the Congregationalists. The American Missionary Association
    and those allied to it have been the chief agency, so far as benevolent effort is
    concerned, in diffusing right notions of religion, and in carrying education to the
    darkened mind of the negro."</p>
    <p>Here is the large door that God has opened for us, and through which we are
    reaching this people, and in a still larger degree may carry the truths of the
    Kingdom of God to them. What they need most of all is light. Give them that and the
    question of rights will take care of itself. When I was in New Orleans last May,
    President Hitchcock, of Straight University, pointed out to me in his office a pile
    of letters, which, he said, were applications for teachers for these public schools,
    and those which he showed me represented the number of applications which he was not
    able to fill. And yet he is compelled every term to turn away scores of young men and
    young women seeking to fit themselves for just this work, because there is not room
    for them and because there are not funds to care for them.</p>
    <p>As to this new movement in the South, I do not conclude that more than the first
    step has been taken, exceedingly important as that step is. Many of the schools as
    yet are in a wretched condition. The buildings in the rural districts are small and
    rudely built, and many of them are positively unfit to be used as school houses.
    There are neither maps, nor charts or other appliances for the teacher's use in his
    work, and in fact everything about these school houses is of the most primitive type.
    The school year often does not exceed four months, and many of these teachers are
    altogether unfit for their tasks.</p>
    <p>Are we to think the time has come to withhold our support and our prayers from
    this great work? Was there ever such an opportunity offered to any land as this which
    is presented to the Christian philanthropy of our own?</p>
    <p>I might tell of the needs of the cabin home life as I have seen them in these
    States, how the scholars from Christian schools are the leaven that is slowly
    transforming this, the greatest of all human institutions; how while from one-quarter
    to one-half of the colored population is progressing, gaining in education, property
    and character, there is another large part of the race that is either stationary or
    sinking into more miserable conditions. Are we seeking for paganism to battle with?
    Here it is in our own proud land. Do we want the opportunity of Christianizing a
    nation? Here it is; and with possibilities just as marked as those of any people that
    ever ascended the scale of intelligence and Christian morality.</p>
    <p>The problem of the New South is not merely one of successful railroads, of busy
    factories or of paying plantations, but much more is it one of upright, wise,
    Christian manhood and womanhood. This is the work to which we are most truly called
    of the Eternal Father.</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>{100}</span>
    <p>Nobly has the American Missionary Association entered into these labors; but
    believe me, there is a larger work before it than it has yet accomplished.</p>

    <h3>THE SOUTH.</h3>
    <a name="south" id="south"></a>
    <h4>LETTER FROM AN EVANGELIST.</h4>
    <p>After my return from England for another winter's service in Gospel work among the
    people of the South, I began at</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>WASHINGTON, D.C.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I had promised Rev. G.W. Moore last winter, before sailing for my home in England,
    to assist him in special religious effort. From the very commencement of the meetings
    a good spirit was manifest, which deepened day by day until forty or more persons
    professed faith in Christ, young and old being reached by the power of the gospel.
    One man sixty-one years of age surrendered to the overtures of God's love and
    received Christ as his Saviour. Another of seventy-five years was pointed out to me
    as a hardened sinner. When approached he was full of self and reason, "I don't
    believe in mourner's benches and such like; do you think my going there will make me
    a Christian or do me any good?" "No, but it will show the people you are intending to
    make a start for Heaven, and it will enlist their sympathy and prayers," I
    replied.</p>
    <p>Finally he knelt with me in the aisle with his head bowed on the end of the seat
    while I prayed. Soon the big tears were dropping from his eyes and he went home that
    night under conviction. The following night he returned. He was again prayed for, but
    went away undecided. The next night as soon as inquirers were given an opportunity to
    present themselves for prayers he was the first to respond, and the sinful man of
    seventy-five years had yielded his heart to Christ, and could sing from his heart
    "Happy day, when Jesus washed my sins away." His wife, who was present, rushed
    forward, and tears of joy ran down their cheeks. Scarcely a dry eye was to be seen,
    while above all there was joy in Heaven over another sinner saved. Deacon R. came to
    me afterwards and said, "Why, did you ever see what a change in the man in three
    days, and at last how he 'caved in.'"</p>
    <p>Ten persons made profession of their faith, in January. Two of these were teachers
    in the public schools. There were four conversions in one family. Since these
    meetings, many extra services have been held, with fruitful results. There are family
    altars where none before existed. The work in Washington under Mr. Moore is very
    hopeful. My next point was</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>SELMA, ALA.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>which I entered full of hopes as to successful meetings, and was not disappointed.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>{101}</span> During my stay
    there, lasting three weeks, sixty professed to be converted. Most of these, through
    the efforts of Rev. C.B. Curtis and his wife, were formed into a "Children's Band,"
    while others joined the churches. This is a most important feature in pastoral work,
    where the majority of the converts are children. They need to have something that
    will help them in their spiritual and new life and which may be instrumental in
    preserving them from temptations, snares and pitfalls, laid to entrap them by the
    enemy of their souls.</p>
    <p>I never before realized how easily people are led away by false teachers, nor saw
    so manifestly brought out the fulfillment of the Scriptures, [2 Pet. ii, 1] "But
    there were false prophets among the people, even as there shall be false teachers
    among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that
    bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction. And many shall follow their
    pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of."</p>
    <p>A man calling himself a "prophet" and a "faith doctor" had been for some time
    experimenting upon people, both white and black, and professed to cure them of all
    their ailments. He had been holding meetings in a cottage weekly, and had gathered
    many followers, who were, alas, for the most part professing Christians. He announced
    that on the following Sunday he would hold the passover feast, burn the Bible, and,
    in plain words, would do wonders, the like of which had not been heard of for years.
    Accordingly, on Sunday morning, with a few of his followers, he came to the house of
    a Negro, and during the ceremony commanded a white woman to place her head on the
    table and offer herself as a sacrifice. She refused, upon which a Negro woman laid
    her head upon the table. He immediately raised an old cavalry sword and, with one
    blow, nearly severed her head from her body, and then commanded that they should
    "drag her out at once and put her with her feet towards the East and she will rise
    after three days."</p>
    <p>Soon there was a cry of murder raised; the false prophet was arrested after a
    struggle, and he, with a number of his followers, was safely lodged in the
    penitentiary, where it is to be hoped he will at least be kept from cutting off any
    more women's heads. Oh, how great the need of faithful men to lift up their voices
    like a trumpet, and spare them not, and show to these needy people, so religiously
    inclined, the way of truth!</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>TALLADEGA COLLEGE</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>was the next place visited. Beginning the New Year, which is usually the "week of
    prayer," for two weeks the "old, old story" was told on every night among the
    resident students and scholars. At other times, services would be held in the Cassidy
    school in the morning, or in the afternoon, as school duties would permit. The
    Theological class, as well as the teachers and faculty, interested themselves greatly
    in seeking to win the unsaved to Jesus. Following out the teaching of the New
    Testament, the students <span class="pagenum"><a name="page102"
    id="page102"></a>{102}</span> went out two and two in the surrounding neighborhood,
    calling at the homes of the people, conversing and praying in the family. They often
    returned with great joy to tell of the success and kindness they had met wherever
    they went. I am thankful to our blessed Lord to be able to report that not only forty
    or more of the young people were converted but also that professing Christians were
    strengthened in faith, all promising to do what God had required of them and to go to
    their respective homes, some of them hundreds of miles away, to make known a
    Saviour's love and to carry light as far as possible in the surrounding darkness.
    While here the Macedonian cry was heard from</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>JENIFER.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I went there for a brief service. The first night the church was full, although
    the weather was stormy. The spirit of God brooded over the meeting and five came
    forward for prayer. The next night still was unpleasant, yet some of the congregation
    came several miles, and at the close eleven inquirers asked for prayers. A brother in
    the congregation rose, and, in pleading terms, his voice faltering, begged, "Oh,
    brodder, please do stop wid us; see de mourners; see de work de Lord is doing; please
    you brodder don't go away and leab us." After such heartfelt words I could but stay
    all the week, when sixteen professed to have accepted Christ, or, as they put it, to
    have "found religion."</p>
    <p>Miss Smith, at her home for motherless girls, is doing a noble work here. Rev.
    J.B. Grant is highly respected by all in the village and has a good name, which is
    worth more than great riches.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>IRONATON</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>was the next place visited. It was exceedingly muddy and dark, yet the people came
    out well. At the close of the first meeting the congregation arose <i>en masse</i>
    and asked that I would remain a day longer, which I did.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>MARION, ALA.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I went to Marion with some doubts upon my mind as to the results. The first
    evening after my arrival I was very sick and threatened with a severe attack of
    chills and fever, but I was helped to strength enough to preach with difficulty.
    Twenty-five inquirers asked for prayers. Some that night became "new creatures in
    Christ Jesus," and every night as the meetings progressed the interest deepened and
    spread, until other churches were reached by the influence and their services given
    up that their members might come to our church and share in the work and blessing.
    Every night large numbers of seekers came to Christ. On one night twelve expressed
    their faith in a new life. Among the many inquirers was one who for twelve years had
    been an anxiety to her friends on account of her state of mind, and her conversion
    caused great joy in the church.</p>
    <p>Short morning meetings were held in the various schools in the town, and in a
    town-school seventeen seekers found the Lord Jesus precious to <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>{103}</span> their souls. Up to
    this time, during two weeks, more than one hundred profess to have been
    converted.</p>
    <p>I am happy to report that now, with the exception of two or three of the students,
    all in the new A.M.A. school have been reached by the gospel and are rejoicing that
    God's love has been shed abroad in their hearts. This blessing can be traced in a
    great measure to the faithful Scriptural teaching which Rev. A.W. Curtis and his
    devoted wife had been giving previous to my coming among them, prayer meetings having
    been held in the church for some time beforehand, and women's meetings at the
    pastor's home, led by Mrs. Curtis, thus preparing the way for the nightly preaching
    of the gospel. I go next to Mobile.</p>

    <h3>THE CHINESE.</h3>
    <h4>RESULTS THAT ELUDE THE STATISTICIAN.</h4>
    <p>BY REV. C.T. WEITZEL.</p>
    <p>There are some effects which cannot be put into statistics. A boy's progress in a
    study is but imperfectly declared by the monthly report or the examination "stand."
    Much of the work accomplished in a Chinese mission school, is impossible to tabulate.
    Like the marvelous clearness of the atmosphere in Santa Barbara on a bright morning
    after a night of rain, it quite eludes the statistician.</p>
    <p>But effects may be felt, though we cannot represent them by figures. Go with me
    some evening through the Chinese quarter of our city; note the faces of the loungers
    in every door-way and at every corner. Watch the expression, or the want of
    expression, in these stolid, brutal, repulsive faces of opium-smokers and gamblers.
    Then step over with me to the Chinese mission-house two squares away. Before you
    enter, look in through the half-open door and take a survey of the scene within. The
    room is well-lighted, and contains, among other things, two long tables, a dozen
    benches, a cabinet organ, and a few chairs. The walls are bright with Scripture texts
    and illustrations from sacred history. About fifteen young Chinamen are seated at the
    tables, all reading and studying aloud in true Chinese fashion. Just as you enter the
    teacher, touches the bell. Books are closed and all take seats on the benches in
    front of the organ. A Chinese evangelist is present, and while he makes an
    impassioned address, accompanied by most expressive gestures, you are free to study
    the faces upturned to listen. What a contrast to the faces you have just left in
    Chinatown, idly staring at the passer-by, or, vacant of all interest, staring at
    nothing! At a glance you perceive effects which must be seen to be appreciated. You
    feel that not only is the whole atmosphere of this place essentially different <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>{104}</span> from that of the
    Chinese quarter, but there is also an essential difference between those who frequent
    the one and the other.</p>
    <p>Socially, intellectually, spiritually, the Chinese mission-school does its
    beneficent work. It must be borne in mind that the Chinaman in California is away
    from home. He is exposed to all the temptations of a stranger in a strange land,
    removed from the restraining influences of a community where one is known. Subject an
    equal number of men of any other nation to this severe test, and I doubt much if they
    would bear it as well. The mission school serves the purpose of a strong social
    support. So far as possible it takes the place of a home. It practically separates
    its attendants into a community by itself. It does much to keep them from contact
    with their vicious countrymen in Chinatown. It does much to bring them into contact
    with those whose influence upon them will be good. It does much to furnish a healthy
    social atmosphere in which to pass the hours of the afternoon and evening, which
    every Chinese servant is at liberty to spend as he will.</p>
    <p>Intellectually the work in the Chinese missions is already far beyond the
    elementary stage, and is growing more virile every year.</p>
    <p>But everything is made but the means to the spiritual end. Not for an hour is this
    lost sight of. The whole drift of the teaching, the songs, the pictures, the
    Scripture text, is to make known Christ. Every evening's lesson ends with worship.
    For a month or more the Chinese preacher to whom I have referred, has held
    evangelistic services in the Santa Barbara mission. To-day he leaves for points
    farther south to do the same work elsewhere.</p>
    <p>In no year, may I add, have there been so many conversions among the Chinese on
    this coast as in the one just past.</p>

    <h4>THE BLACK WOMAN OF THE SOUTH.</h4>
    <p>The Rev. Alexander Crummell, D.D., formerly a missionary in Africa and now Rector
    of St. Luke's Church in Washington, D.C., is a native of Africa, a graduate of one of
    the leading Universities of England, who adds to the strength and graces of a sound
    scholarship, the devotion of a noble Christian character.</p>
    <p>From an address made by him upon the "Needs and Neglects of the Black Woman of the
    South," we quote his plea for "Woman's Work for Woman." Referring to the Negro woman
    in slavery days, he says:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"She was a 'hewer of wood and a drawer of water.' She had to keep her place in
      the gang from morn till eve, under the burden of a heavy task, or under the
      stimulus or the fear of a cruel lash. She was a picker of cotton. She labored at
      the sugar mill and in the tobacco factory. When, through weariness or sickness, she
      had fallen behind her allotted task, then came, as punishment, the fearful stripes
      upon her shrinking, lacerated flesh.</p>
      <p>"Her home life was of the most degrading nature. She lived in the rudest huts,
      and partook of the coarsest food, and dressed in the scantiest garb, and slept, in
      multitudinous cabins, upon the hardest boards!</p>
      <p>"There was no sanctity of family, no binding tie of marriage, none of the fine
      felicities and the endearing affections of home. Few of these things were the lot
      of the Southern black woman. Instead, thereof, a gross barbarism, which tended to
      blunt the tender sensibilities, to obliterate feminine delicacy and womanly shame,
      came down as her heritage from generation to generation; and it seems a miracle of
      providence and grace that, notwithstanding these terrible circumstances, so much
      struggling virtue lingered amid the rude cabins, that so much womanly worth and
      sweetness remained, as slaveholders themselves have borne witness to.</p>
      <p>"Freed, legally, she has been; but the act of emancipation had no talismanic
      influence to reach to and alter and transform her degrading social life. The truth
      is, 'Emancipation Day' found her a prostrate and degraded being; and, although it
      has brought numerous advantages to her sons, it has produced but the simplest
      changes in <i>her</i> social and domestic condition. She is still the crude, rude,
      ignorant mother. Remote from cities, the dweller still in the old plantation hut,
      neighboring to the sulky, disaffected master-class, who still think her freedom was
      a personal robbery of themselves, none of the 'fair humanities' have visited her
      humble home. The light of knowledge has not fallen upon her eyes. The fine
      domesticities which give the charm to family life, and which, by the refinement and
      delicacy of womanhood, preserve the civilization of nations, have not come to
      <i>her</i>. She has still the rude, coarse labor of men. With her rude husband, she
      still shares the hard service of a field-hand. Her house, which shelters, perhaps,
      some six or eight children, embraces but two rooms. Her furniture is of the rudest
      kind. The clothing of the household is scant and of the coarsest material; has
      oft-times the garniture of rags, and for herself and offspring is marked, not
      seldom, by the absense <span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"
      id="page106"></a>{106}</span> of both hats and shoes. She has rarely been taught to
      sew, and the field-labor of slavery times has kept her ignorant of the habitudes of
      neatness and the requirements of order. Indeed, coarse food, coarse clothes, coarse
      living, coarse manners, coarse companions, coarse surroundings, coarse neighbors,
      both white and black, yea, everything coarse, down to the coarse, ignorant,
      senseless religion, which excites her sensibilities and starts her passions, go to
      make up the life of the masses of black women in the hamlets and villages of the
      South. This is the state of black womanhood.</p>
      <p>"And now look at the <i>vastness</i> of this degradation. If I had been speaking
      of the population of a city, or town, or even a village, the tale would be a sad
      and melancholy one. But I have brought before you the condition of <i>millions of
      women</i>. And when you think that the masses of these women live in the rural
      districts; that they grow up in rudeness and ignorance; that their former masters
      are using few means to break up their hereditary degradation, you can easily take
      in the pitiful condition of this population and forecast the inevitable future to
      multitudes of females, unless a mighty special effort is made for the improvement
      of the black womanhood of the South.</p>
      <p>"I am anxious for a permanent and uplifting civilization to be engrafted on the
      Negro race in this land. And this can only be secured through the womanhood of a
      race. If you want the civilization of a people to reach the very best elements of
      their being, and then, having reached them, there to abide as an indigenous
      principle, you must imbue the <i>womanhood</i> of that people with all its elements
      and qualities. Any movement which passes by the female sex is an ephemeral thing.
      Without them, no true nationality, patriotism, religion, cultivation, family life,
      or true social status, is a possibility. In this matter it takes two to make
      one&mdash;mankind is a duality. The male may bring, as an exotic, a foreign graft,
      say, of civilization, to a new people. But what then! Can a graft live or thrive of
      itself? By no manner of means. It must get vitality from the stock into which it is
      put; and it is the women who give the sap to every human organization which thrives
      and flourishes on earth.</p>
      <p>"I plead, therefore, for the establishment of at least one large '<i>Industrial
      school</i>' in every Southern State for the black girls of the South. I ask for the
      establishment of schools which may serve specially the home life of the rising
      womanhood of my race.</p>
      <p>"I want <i>boarding schools</i> for the <i>industrial training</i> of one
      hundred and fifty or two hundred of the poorest girls, of the ages of twelve to
      eighteen years.</p>
      <p>"I wish the intellectual training to be limited to reading, writing, arithmetic
      and geography.</p>
      <p>"I would have these girls taught to do accurately all domestic work, such as
      sweeping floors, dusting rooms, scrubbing, bed-making, washing and ironing, sewing,
      mending and knitting.</p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>{107}</span>
      <p>"I would have the trades of dress-making, millinery, straw-plating, tailoring
      for men, and such like, taught them.</p>
      <p>"The art of cooking should be made a specialty, and every girl should be
      instructed in it.</p>
      <p>"In connection with these schools, garden plats should be cultivated, and every
      girl should be required daily, to spend at least an hour in learning the
      cultivation of small fruits, vegetables and flowers.</p>
      <p>"It is hardly possible to exaggerate either the personal, family or society
      influence which would flow from these schools. Every class, yea, every girl in an
      out-going class, would be a missionary of thrift, industry, common-sense, and
      practicality. They would go forth, year by year, a leavening power into the houses,
      towns and villages of the Southern black population; girls fit to be the wives of
      the honest peasantry of the South, the worthy matrons of their numerous
      households.</p>
      <p>"I am looking after the domestic training of the <i>masses</i>; for the raising
      up of women meet to be the helpers of poor men, the <i>rank and file</i> of black
      society, all through the rural districts of the South.</p>
      <p>"A true civilization can only be attained when the life of woman is reached, her
      whole being permeated by noble ideas, her fine taste enriched by culture, her
      tendencies to the beautiful gratified and developed, her singular and delicate
      nature lifted up to its full capacity, and then, when all these qualities are fully
      matured, cultivated and sanctified, all their sacred influences shall circle around
      ten thousand firesides, and the cabins of the humblest freedmen shall become the
      homes of Christian refinement through the influence of the uplifted and cultivated
      black woman of the South."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The above appeal is in the line of our American Missionary Association work. While
    we have higher schools and institutions for more thorough education, which these
    Negro women need as much as any women in the world, we are increasingly developing
    this idea which Dr. Crummell eloquently pleads.</p>
    <p>We remind our friends and those Christian women who are interested in the
    uplifting of Negro womanhood, that the American Missionary Association, the
    <i>ordained agency</i> of the Congregational Churches for this work, could do much
    more of it if the means were forthcoming. The marked success of the domestic training
    in our schools at Tougaloo, Miss., Talladega, Ala., Thomasville, Ga., Memphis, Tenn.,
    and other points, shows the advantage gained in the twenty-five years' experience
    which the A.M.A. has had in its work for the Negroes.</p>
    <p>We need the co-operation of all Christian women in carrying on these Industrial
    Schools already established, and to enable us to establish and carry forward <i>many
    more</i>.</p>

    <h3>YOUNG FOLKS.</h3>
    <h4>WHAT SUSIE FOUND AT TOUGALOO.</h4>
    <p>(SEE FEBRUARY AMERICAN MISSIONARY.)</p>
    <p>A roomful of girls of various sizes and complexions, all very much intent upon
    their work, and no one thinking just at that moment of a traveled fairy daughter, to
    adopt and love as her own, sent by a beneficent and tender-hearted northern "Fay." I
    doubt if Susie ever before saw so many "little women" laboring with needles and
    trying to set the troublesome stitches straight and even, to keep the thread from
    tangling and the seam clean. The results are far from perfection, but they are
    encouraging.</p>
    <p>Some of the children <i>wear</i> thimbles, and some set them upon their desks and
    <i>wiggle</i> the needle through without their aid. Here is a child so tiny that no
    thimble in the box will serve her. She has a delicate face, with big brown eyes, and
    her fingers are the slenderest of appendages to her atoms of hands. Her sister, a
    year or so older, has a round, chubby face, with plump, dimpled, brown hands, but
    these fat fingers also must grow to the smallest thimble. Here is a quiet, modest
    little girl whose five baptismal names, Cynthia Ann Finetta Bloomfield Celeste,
    furnish her nothing prettier for every day use than "Lusty." She could not thread a
    needle or tie a knot when she joined the Hope Band, and the second year she wore one
    of the smallest thimbles with a bit of cloth inside for "chinking" to keep it on.
    Here Susie's sympathies are drawn out towards a thin, nervous-looking little Frances,
    who has a hand and foot crippled. She walks painfully along to her place and holds
    her work at a disadvantage in the poor little cramped left hand, but she likes to be
    there with the others.</p>
    <p>Most of the heads are covered with little tight braids, on some heads standing at
    every angle, on some laid smoothly down, one braid tied to another. A few have their
    curly hair cropped close, and here is a little girl with a bushy mass overshadowing
    her lively face. She takes but a stitch or two until she goes up to the front and
    holds her work out for her teacher's inspection. Some time elapses before that lady
    can notice it and say, "That is pretty good, Lena; now go right on carefully." Lena
    returns slowly to her place, takes a stitch or two more and repeats the performance.
    When will the work be completed? O no, that is the way she used to do, but
    <i>now</i>&mdash;</p>
    <p>A middle-sized "Topsy" comes pushing rudely forward, tossing her head and
    whispering disagreeable things to those she has to pass, and Susy hopes she will not
    be brought into any closer relations with <i>her</i>, when she happens to see her
    tenderly fondling a broken-armed, broken-legged dollie, while her work is being
    adjusted, and thinks somewhat better of her. There are several Lilies and Roses in
    this growing garden. The lilies are not white and the roses are not red, but more
    attractive and interesting to their teacher's eyes than the black pansies the flower
    gardeners <span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>{109}</span>
    labored so long to produce. Their teacher is fond of flowers and has her windows
    full, even in winter, but she does not smile upon them with such a heartful of
    affection as upon these, nor can those bask in the light of her merry face more
    freely. As her short, round figure moves down the aisle and back, and Susie gets a
    good look at her, she says to herself, "Why surely this is Mrs. Santa Claus! How glad
    I am!" and it is not a strange conclusion, for her figure and expression <i>are</i>
    like the poet's description of dear Saint Nick.</p>
    <p>Here is a girl in one of the side seats a good deal taller than her teacher.
    Through the long, bright, warm summer she works in the cotton and the corn, alongside
    of father, brothers, uncles, men and women, boys and girls. Her hands are enlarged
    and roughened with toil, but she is taking pains to learn how to do this useful
    indoor work skillfully too.</p>
    <p>There is a goodly company of these larger girls, but Susie does not feel any more
    afraid of them, nor of "the middle-sized bears and the wee tiny, small bears" than
    did little Silverhair in the nursery tale. She doubts, however, if these largest ones
    have not laid aside dollies, and thinks she must look among the "leaster" ones for
    the little <i>step-mother</i> who will respect her own little Fay-mother's request to
    "take good care of her." But when the sewing-lesson is ended and she notices one and
    another bring to light a little dollie-daughter to hug in her arms as she walks
    homeward, and sees the sociable interest of all the rest, she feels no further doubt
    about the mother-love in all these little Southern bosoms and resigns all care as to
    which one shall be hers, leaving the whole question to Mrs. Santa Claus.</p>
    <p>Perhaps some day we may call upon her when she is fully domesticated in her new
    home. There will not be many comforts and conveniences in that home. Possibly when we
    ask for Susie, her mamma will draw a little old box from under the head of her bed,
    as once when I called upon one of these little girls and asked her if she had a doll.
    It had lost some of its limbs and it was dressed in odds and ends, tacked together by
    the untaught little mother, but when I set the dollie on my knee and pretended to
    drink tea out of one of the tiny toy cups set forth from the same treasure-box, you
    could not find a more hilarious little mamma anywhere, though you should pick out one
    with all nursery stores at her command.</p>

    <h4>A LETTER FROM ONE OF OUR INDIAN PUPILS IN NEBRASKA.</h4>
    <p>SANTEE AGENCY, NEB.</p>
    <p><i>Dear Eastern Friends</i>:&mdash;We have had five good prayer meetings during
    two weeks, and I am very glad to tell you dear friends that some of our school-mates
    said they will try and do as God wants them to do. And some pray who never did
    before. No words can tell how I felt one evening <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page110" id="page110"></a>{110}</span> after we came home from meeting. Just
    before I went up stairs I asked the Matron if I could talk Dakota to tell my
    room-mate about the meeting. The subject was, "What must I do to be saved?" I told it
    to her the best I could. After I was through talking I asked her if she understood
    all what I meant and she said "Yes." We both were silent for one minute. I was
    praying to God in my heart to help me to help this dear school-mate of mine. Then in
    a little while she said, "I believe in Jesus and now I will always try and be a
    Christian." When she said that, I couldn't do anything more, I was so glad that my
    tears came. And before we went to sleep I ask her to pray after I did, and she did;
    this was the first time she prayed in her own words. It was so dark and I couldn't
    see anything but I knew she was crying by the way she spoke. After long time I
    thought she went to sleep; but all at once she call my name and said, "I wish
    tomorrow morning they would sing in Dakota, '<i>Ring the bells in heaven, there is
    great joy to-day</i>.'" Dear friends we kindly ask you to remember us when you offer
    prayer to our dear God.</p>
    <p>Your friend,</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
